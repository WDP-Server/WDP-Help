# Base Detection System (WDP-BaseDet)

The server automatically detects and protects player bases!

## How It Works

### Automatic Detection
The server monitors player activity to identify bases:
- Building activity
- Chest placement
- Time spent in an area
- Block modifications

### Protection
Once a base is detected:
- You'll be notified
- Basic protection is applied
- You can manage trust settings

## Trust System

### Managing Trusted Players
Use the trust GUI to manage who can access your base:
- Add trusted players
- Remove trusted players
- Set different trust levels

### Trust Levels
- **Full Trust:** Can build, break, and access containers
- **Container Trust:** Can access chests only
- **Access Trust:** Can use doors and buttons

## Commands

### Base Management
- Check your base status through the GUI
- Manage trusted players
- View base boundaries

## Offline Protection
Your base gets extra protection when you're offline:
- Reduced damage from other players
- Notifications sent to Discord when attacked
- Activity logging for review

## Tips
- Build a clear base structure for better detection
- Use the trust system wisely
- Check Discord for offline raid notifications
