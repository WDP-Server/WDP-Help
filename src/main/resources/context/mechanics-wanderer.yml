# The Rogue Wanderer Event

Hunt down the mysterious Rogue Wanderer roaming the server for valuable rewards!

## Quick Start
1. Use **/hint** to get your current clue for the Wanderer's location
2. Hunt it down and defeat it
3. Defeat it 3 times to earn a rare **Beam Stone**
4. Check Discord for spawn notifications

## How The Hunt Works

### Getting Hints
- **Command:** `/hint`
- Hints update daily at **15:00 server time**
- Your first hint gets you started
- Each defeat gives you better hints to find the next spawn
- Hints get more specific as you get closer

### Winning Rewards
- **First Defeat:** Standard loot drops
- **Second Defeat:** Improved rewards
- **Third Defeat:** Earn the rare **Beam Stone** (valuable item!)
- Hunt it again for additional loot

### Strategy Tips
- Bring good combat gear (the Wanderer is tough)
- Team up with other players for better odds
- Check the Discord #wanderer-hunts channel for updates
- Use `/hint` regularly for the latest location clue
- The Wanderer moves, so hints change as you search

## Discord Integration
Join the server Discord for real-time notifications:
- **#wanderer-hunts** - Spawn alerts
- **#hunts-completed** - Victory announcements
- **#hints-updates** - New hints available

The Wanderer hunt is a core server event - everyone participates. Track it down and claim your rewards!
